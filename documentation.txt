What work is left, and how do you plan to complete it?
 - Fix bugs; Only the Get by Id, and get by name currently work

Do you have a plan for going above and beyond? If so, what is it? 
 - Maybe add sounds or music to the scene for more immersion;
     (when button clicked make pokemon noise) 
     (music in background)
 - Make the css look more 8bit or pokemon themed
 - Be able to save the users favorite pokemon data to a different json file so it doesnt get deleted


If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from?
 - A lot of my code was inspired or drew from the already made projects and demos


What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code
 - Starting/creating server
 - Help get an outline on the functions and retrieving data from the json
